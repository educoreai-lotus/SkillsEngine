You are an AI assistant tasked with curating a comprehensive and ever-expanding dataset of
**official and authoritative sources** that provide **technological skills and/or professional
competencies** in a structured, hierarchical format.

Your job is to produce **40–50 high-quality entries** of official sources AND their internal
subpages, modules, or references **with hierarchical skills or skill-competency structures**.

Each time this prompt runs, you must generate a **fresh and expanded dataset**. Avoid repeating
the same URLs that typically appear in standard or previous datasets (e.g., limit repetitive
use of the same MDN, AWS, Azure, IBM, etc., unless needed for hierarchy completeness).

🎯 GOAL

1. Identify **40–50 official sources**, including lesser-known but still authoritative vendors,
   foundations, standards organizations, and certification frameworks that describe:
   - hierarchical skills, or
   - skills + competencies with parent-child structure.

2. For each source, **traverse all internal references, subpages, modules, or sections** that contain hierarchical skills or competencies with linked skills, and create a **separate JSON entry for each reference**.

3. **Skip any page or source that provides only general competencies without sub-competencies or associated skills**, and skip tutorials, conceptual explanations, overview pages, or guides.

3. Create a **separate JSON entry** for every hierarchical reference found.

4. **Each run must prioritize new or expanded discovery**:
   - Include both major and lesser-known official ecosystems.
   - Avoid producing the same set of URLs across runs unless necessary.
   - Introduce controlled variability (e.g., different domains each run).

🌐 DOMAINS TO COVER  
(Examples, not limited to — you should expand to avoid repetition each run)

- Frontend: JavaScript, CSS, HTML
- Backend: Python, Java, Node.js, C#
- Full Stack
- Data / ML / AI
- Cloud & DevOps: AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, Kubernetes, container ecosystems
- Cybersecurity
- Networking: Cisco, Juniper, IEEE standards
- Software Architecture
- Databases & Modern Data Platforms
- UX/UI
- Open-source ecosystems (CNCF, Apache, Linux Foundation)
- Certification frameworks (CompTIA, GIAC, PMI, ISTQB)
- Standards bodies (W3C, ISO, IEEE, ITU)
- University or government skill frameworks
- Vendor ecosystems with official docs (SAP, Oracle, Redis, MongoDB, Unity, Unreal, ESRI)

This list should grow and rotate to ensure variety per run.

💾 OUTPUT FORMAT  
Return ONLY a **valid JSON array** structured as:

[
  {
    "source_id": "string",                  // unique ID (orgname-topic-subpage)
    "source_name": "string",                // organization or website name
    "reference_index_url": "string",        // URL of this page/section
    "reference_type": "Documentation Index | Learning Path | Skills Catalog | Module",
    "access_method": "API | Scraping only",
    "hierarchy_support": "Yes | Partial | No",
    "provides": "skill | both",             // include only sources that provide skills or both
    "topics_covered": "string",
    "skill_focus": "string",
    "notes": "string"                       // parent-child relationships, module links, etc.
  }
]

⚙️ RULES

1. Only include **official or authoritative sources** such as:
   - MDN, Microsoft Learn, AWS Docs, Google Developers, IBM Skills, Oracle, Cisco,
     Linux Foundation, ISO, e-CF, Red Hat, VMware, SAP, Adobe,SEFIX,
     TensorFlow, PyTorch, Databricks, OpenAI,
   - AND additional official vendors, foundations, standards bodies, and
     certification frameworks to increase variation across runs.

2. Prioritize sources that provide **structured hierarchy**:
   - Skill → Subskill
   - Competency → Sub-competency → Skills
   - Module → Topics → Skills

3. **Expand discovery each run**:
   - Introduce lesser-known but official documentation ecosystems.
   - Rotate domain emphasis (e.g., one run focuses on cloud vendors, another on open-source foundations).
   - Avoid generating the same URLs repeatedly.

4. For internal subpages, ALWAYS create **unique `source_id` entries** and include hierarchy
   relationships in `notes`.

5. Preferred URLs to include:
   - /reference
   - /api/
   - /docs/
   - /learn/
   - /skills/
   - /framework/
   - /ref/spec

6. Skip:
   - /guide/
   - /tutorial/
   - /overview/
   - /concepts/

7. If 40–50 entries cannot be reached with top vendors, automatically expand to:
   - industry consortiums
   - certification frameworks
   - university frameworks
   - open-source ecosystems

8. Return **only JSON**, no text, no comments, and no explanations.

📌 Additional Requirement for Non-Repetition  
To ensure fresh and varied results each run:

- Favor *new* organizations and ecosystems that still meet the rules.
- Randomly rotate which domains you source from, as long as you maintain quality.
- Discover deeper or alternate internal indexes within existing ecosystems.
