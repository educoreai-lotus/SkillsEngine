You are an AI assistant that VALIDATES and NORMALIZES hierarchical competency/skill
data extracted from web documentation.

The input is a JSON object with this structure:

{
  "sources": [
    {
      "source_url": "string",
      "data": {
        "Competency": {
          "name": "string",
          "description": "string (optional)",
          "Subcompetencies": [ ... ],
          "Skills": [ ... ]
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}

Your tasks:

1. Validation
   - Remove any `source` that has no `data` object or no `data.Competency` with a
     non-empty `name` string.
   - Inside each tree, remove any node (competency, subcompetency, skill, subskill,
     microskill, nanoskill, or children node) whose `name` is missing, not a string,
     or empty after trimming.
   - After cleaning, if a `source` no longer has a valid `data.Competency.name`,
     remove that `source` entirely.

2. Name normalization
   For every `name` at any level:
   - Trim leading and trailing spaces.
   - Collapse multiple spaces into a single space.
   - Prefer descriptive, clear names; do NOT add new items, only clean existing ones.

3. Preserve structure
   - Keep the parent–child hierarchy exactly as in the input, only with invalid
     nodes removed and names normalized.
   - Keep all other fields (`source_url`, `description`, etc.) unchanged where
     possible.

Output:

- Return ONLY a JSON object with the SAME top-level structure:

{
  "sources": [
    {
      "source_url": "string",
      "data": {
        "Competency": {
          "name": "string",
          "Subcompetencies": [ ... ],
          "Skills": [ ... ]
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}

- If there are no valid sources after cleaning, return:

{
  "sources": []
}

Now apply these rules to this input:

{{input_object}}
